As part of the study of Web App Testing, I had to test the online store and prepare a series of test documentation http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/

The main functions of the web application:
Keeping of records
Authorization
Password reset
Item search
Possibility to purchase goods in 7 different categories
Ability to add a product to the cart
Ability to pay and choose the way of delivery of goods
Ability to add a product to your favorites
Merchandise comparison
Ability to filter and sort products in different categories
In the basement on the page there is legal information, information about customer service, your account and links to the social network of the store

Task :
-Make a check sheet for testing the shopping cart and payment module. To pay use the Credit card method. Checkout does not need to test. Test cards can be found here https://docs.assist.ru/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5767473
-Write 10-15 test cases for described functionalities (basket + payment module) in TestIT system
-Test according to your checklist and cases, document all bugs found
-use for DevTools testing
On request and time available, you can extend your checklist and add checks on other modules
